Define your scenario\nFinally, let's predict emissions under *competitive* bidding with the given carbon price.\n\n`D_R4_H1` through `D_R6_H4`: demand for round 4, hour 1 through round 6, hour 4. These variables are used the same as `demand_sp` above, where 0 results no adjustment made to demand, a number between -1 and 1 results in a percentage change to demand, and a number larger than 1 results in demand being set at that value. For example, `D_R4_H1`=-0.3 results in decreasing the demand forecast for round 4, hour 1 by 30%, and `D_R4_H1`=17000 results in the demand forecast for round 4, hour 1 being replaced by 17,000 MWh.
