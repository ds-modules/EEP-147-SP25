    "For the capacity expansion exercise, we will assume perfect competition in the hourly market: that all plants will be their marginal cost. This is a simplification, but a good first step to simulating what the market might look like after we retire some old plants and build some new plants. If we needed to do this more accurately, you would want to build in some ability of the firms to bid above their marginal cost if it were profit-maximizing to do so. You could do this by changing the `Bid` column of the `bids` dataframe that is put into `price_calc` later in the notebook.\n",

The goal is to find the right mix of plants across the entire generator fleet that will meet demand at the least cost while also achieving our emissions goal.\n",

    "You can use the seasonal supply profiles below to help determine which plant types you might need to meet demand at least cost while remaining within your emissions budget. The plots below show the maximum capacity for wind and solar at different hours of the day for a 100MW plant. For example, a 100MW solar plant can run at nearly the full 100MW capacity at 12pm during summer, but can only generate about 80MW at 12pm in fall.\n",
